# 96rp_pager
<h2>Upgraded Pager script from tugamars by me, panda :)</h2>
<p>
   Everybody is free to use and modify this script!<br>
   Credits for the original creator and me would be nice ofc :D<br>
</p>
<p>
   This script was made in "NINETY SIX RP" as a mobile phone replacement!<br>
   Right now, you can only use it with QBX-Core.<br>
   (unless you can code and replace the events)<br>
   its fully optimized with understandable code and it only uses the database<br>
   every hour and before scheduled restarts if needed.<br>
   You can also use /savePagers as an admin for saving data into the database!
</p>
<p>
   Feel free to join our discord and support us if u want to :)<br>
   We dont sell anything and want to offer free scripts in the near future<br>
   You can also ask us for help or report bugs with a ticket on our discord!

   I have commented out "grabAudio.pause();" and "grabAudio.load();"<br>
   in line 57-58 (nui/scripts.js) because the sound is annoying.<br>
   Just remove those "//" and you will be able to hear this sound.<br>
